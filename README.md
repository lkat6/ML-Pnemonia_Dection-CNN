Pneumonia Identification with CNn

Chest x-ray Images Project Introduction for pneumonia detection with deep learning method Context Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. It kills more children younger than 5 years old each year than any other infectious disease, such as HIV infection, malaria, or tuberculosis. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-rays may help confirm the diagnosis.

Content This dataset contains 5,856 validated chest X-Ray images. The images are split into a training set and a testing set of independent patients. Images are labeled as (disease:NORMAL/BACTERIA/VIRUS)-(randomized patient ID)-(image number of a patient). For details of the data collection and description, see the referenced paper below.

According to the paper, the images (anterior-posterior) were selected from the retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou.

Why do I select this project
In this project, CNN algorithm is used to identify the symptoms of pneumonia from chest X-ray images of the patients. This technique would substantially help improve our current health care system during both emergency and regular periods.

In regular times,the time cost of healthcare service is especially important in developing countries where a doctor needs to consult 20-30 patients a day in average. The X-Ray image identification shall facilitate the doctors in disease dignostic processes, leading to a faster medical service.

In emergency times, like during the early stage of the Convid-19 pandemic, as no quick scanning test (PCR) was invented, doctors relied on chest X-ray imaging to distinguish Convid-19. Since hospitals are full of patients await for treatments and doctors and nurses are working under overwhelmed pressure, CNN technique shall effectively take the burden from the doctors and thus saving more time for those who need immediate cares.

In this study,instead of the Convid-19, the CNN is applied to the detection of pneumonia from children under 5 years old. However, the CNN deep learning mentality can be used in many other chest symptom identification processes
